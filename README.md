# number-occurrence

Write a method that returns a List of the numbers from a specified int array that appear n OR more times in that array.



For example, findNumbersWithCount(new int[] { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 4, 5 }, 2) should find all the numbers in the specified array that appear 2 OR more times and return a list of them i.e. this example call should return a list with the numbers [2,3,4,5]. That is to say in this example array, element 1 occurs once, 2 twice, 3 three times, 4 four times, and 5 five times, making elements that appear two OR more times 2,3,4 and 5.



If there are no matches an empty list should be returned.
